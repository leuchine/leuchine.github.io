I am affiliated with &lt;a href="https://fintechacademy.cs.hku.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the HKU-SCF FinTech Academy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the HKU NLP group&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="goal-and-style">Goal and Style&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The goal of research is to generate knowledge and train new researchers. The prime motivation of publishing papers is to provide insights and make real-world impact. I hope to build a close-knit and focused group, where I value one-on-one meetings with group members and team collaboration. Eventually, I hope my students can develop their own research tastes and pursue their research agenda independently. &lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ongoing-projects">Ongoing Projects&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. I value real-world applications. Here are some ongoing projects in my research group. &lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Natural language processing: large language models and data-centric AI (e.g. data quality and synthetic data generation).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AI for finance: financial NLP and AI for blockchain/web3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AI for science: sequential models (e.g. transformer) and relational models (e.g. graph neural networks) for proteins and molecules.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="documents">Documents&lt;/h4>
