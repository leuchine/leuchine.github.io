I have multiple fully-funded PhD, MPhil, Postdoc, RA, and intern positions at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong. I am affiliated with *[the HKU-SCF FinTech Academy](https://fintechacademy.cs.hku.hk/)* and *[the HKU NLP group](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/)*.

#### Goal and Style

The goal of research is to generate knowledge and train new researchers. I have worked with a few amazing researchers and mentors and I do believe in the power of advising. I hope to build a close-knit and focused group, where I value one-on-one meetings with group members and team collaboration. The prime motivation for publishing papers is to provide insights and make real-world impact. Eventually, I hope my students can develop their own research tastes and pursue their research agenda independently. 

#### Ongoing Projects

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. I value real-world applications. Here are some ongoing projects in my research group. 

1. Natural language processing: large language models and data-centric AI (e.g. data quality and synthetic data generation).
2. AI for finance: financial NLP and AI for blockchain/web3.
3. AI for science: sequential models (e.g. transformer) and relational models (e.g. graph neural networks) for proteins and molecules.

#### Documents

To get to know applicants better, please send the following documents to me. I will read every application carefully. Due to the volume of emails, I am sorry that I cannot respond to every email.

1. CV.
2. Transcripts.
3. Research proposal.
4. Selected publications (if any).
5. Github (if any).
6. TOEFL/GRE/IELTS (if any).
